# Hybrid ASR–NLP Disfluency Restoration System

This project addresses the task of **Automatic Disfluency Restoration**: reconstructing the original *spoken*, disfluent transcript (with fillers, hesitations, and repetitions) from a **clean transcript and its corresponding speech audio**.

This work focuses on building a **robust, compute-efficient hybrid ASR–NLP pipeline** suitable for Kaggle notebook environments.

---

## Problem Overview

Human speech naturally contains disfluencies such as:

* fillers (e.g., *uh, um, hmm*)
* repetitions (e.g., *I… I think*)
* hesitations and false starts

While many speech and NLP systems aim to *remove* these artifacts, this task requires doing the **reverse**:

> **Restore disfluencies that were originally spoken but removed from clean transcripts.**

---

## Dataset Description

The dataset used in this project is the **NPPE-2: Automatic Disfluency Restoration** dataset and is **included alongside the code in this repository**.

### Dataset Contents

The dataset contains both text and audio modalities:

#### Training Data

* **Disfluent transcripts** (text)
* **List of unique disfluency tokens**
* Used to automatically derive clean transcripts and learn disfluency insertion patterns

#### Test Data

* **Clean transcripts** (text)
* **Corresponding speech audio** (`.wav`)
* Goal: predict the original disfluent transcript

---

## Using the Dataset with Kaggle

Although the dataset is included in this repository, the notebook is designed to be executed **inside a Kaggle Notebook**.

### Step 1: Download the Repository

* Download or clone this GitHub repository to your local system.
* Ensure the dataset files are present exactly as provided.

---

### Step 2: Upload Data to Kaggle Notebook

1. Open **Kaggle → Notebooks**
2. Create a new notebook
3. Upload this notebook file
4. Upload the dataset folder manually via the **“Add Data” → “Upload”** option

---

### Step 3: Expected Directory Structure in Kaggle

Once uploaded, the dataset must be available in the Kaggle environment with the following structure:

```
/kaggle/input/nppe-2-automatic-disfluency-restoration/
├── train.csv
├── test.csv
├── unique_disfluencies.csv
└── downloaded_audios/
    ├── 0001.wav
    ├── 0002.wav
    └── ...
```

> The folder name and structure must remain unchanged for the notebook to run correctly.

---

### Step 4: Dataset Path Used in Code

The notebook assumes the following dataset paths:

```python
INPUT_DIR = '/kaggle/input/nppe-2-automatic-disfluency-restoration'
AUDIO_DIR = os.path.join(INPUT_DIR, 'downloaded_audios')
```

No additional configuration is required.

## Approach Summary

Instead of training a large end-to-end generation model, this project adopts a **hybrid, evidence-driven approach** that balances accuracy and computational efficiency.

### 1. Data Preprocessing

* Programmatically derive **clean transcripts** from disfluent training text using known disfluency tokens.
* Align clean and disfluent transcripts to learn **what disfluencies occur and where they are inserted**.

### 2. Audio Evidence via ASR

* Use **Whisper ASR (tiny)** to transcribe test audio.
* Treat ASR output as *noisy spoken evidence*, not ground truth.

### 3. Controlled Disfluency Insertion

* Compare ASR output with clean transcripts to identify candidate insertions.
* Insert disfluencies only when supported by:

  * Known disfluency tokens
  * Previously observed insertion patterns from training data
  * Reduction in edit distance to ASR output

### 4. Retrieval-Based Fallback

* Apply **TF-IDF similarity** over training data when ASR evidence is weak.
* Borrow disfluency patterns from similar sentences conservatively.

This design prioritizes **precision over hallucination**, ensuring natural and realistic outputs.
